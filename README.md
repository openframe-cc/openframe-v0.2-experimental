# OpenFrame – v0.2 Experimental Prototype

This repository contains the first experimental design files for **OpenFrame v0.2**, a hybrid bicycle-frame concept combining **3D-printed PA12-CF lugs** with **bamboo veneer tubes**.  
This version is an early **R&D prototype** and is **not intended for public-road use** or any scenario where structural failure may cause injury.

## 🧪 About the Project

OpenFrame is an **open-source, experimental hardware project** exploring how natural materials and additive manufacturing can be combined into modular bicycle frames.

The v0.2 prototype investigates:
- 3D-printed **PA12-CF** structural lugs  
- **Bamboo veneer tubes** (N-Vision)  
- Modular joint geometry  
- Assembly and bonding concepts  
- Frame alignment and stiffness testing  

This version is an **experimental, non-certified prototype**.  
Its purpose is **development**, not safe riding.
